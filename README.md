## D3 examples

In this repository I will be posting examples using D3. D3.js is a JavaScript library that is used for data visualization using the web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG. Since the initial release in 2011, D3 gained popularity pretty quickly due to dynamic, interactive data visualizations capabilities in the browser. There is a huge community of followers of D3, and it is supported and improved by its creator Mike Bostock constantly.
